/* 
COUNT BY X

Create a function with two arguments that will return an array of the first n multiples of x.

Assume both the given number and the number of times to count will be positive numbers greater than 0.

Return the results as an array or list ( depending on language ).

Ex:
countBy(1,10) === [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
countBy(2,5) === [2,4,6,8,10]
*/

const countBy = (x, n) => {
  let z = []
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      z.push(i * x)
    }
  return z;
}

console.log(countBy(1,10), [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], "Array does not match")
console.log(countBy(2,5), [2,4,6,8,10], "Array does not match")
