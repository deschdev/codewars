# Codewars Solutions
A journey through Codewars - main goal is to get to Kyu3 by end of 2024

A collection of my solutions to various Codewars challenges. This project showcases my problem-solving skills and proficiency in different programming languages.

**How It's Made:**
**Tech used:** JavaScript (ES6+)

This project is built using JavaScript to solve different coding challenges from Codewars. Each solution is written with a focus on clarity, efficiency, and best practices. The solutions are organized by difficulty level, demonstrating my ability to tackle a wide range of problems using JavaScript.

Here's a breakdown of how the solutions are structured:

<ul>
 <li> **Basic Challenges**: Solutions utilizing fundamental JavaScript concepts such as loops, conditionals, and basic data structures</li>
 <li>**Intermediate Challenges**: Implementations showcasing more advanced topics like higher-order functions, closures, and asynchronous programming.</li>
 <li>**Advanced Challenges**: Solutions leveraging complex algorithms and data structures, as well as modern JavaScript features such as ES6 modules, Promises, and async/await</li>
</ul>

By working through these challenges, I honed my skills in algorithmic thinking, data structure manipulation, and efficient coding practices.

**Optimizations**
In this section, I highlight some of the key optimizations made to improve the performance and readability of my solutions:

<ul>
  <li>**Refactoring**: Many solutions were revisited and refactored to enhance their efficiency. For example, I optimized a sorting algorithm from O(n^2) to O(n log n) by switching from bubble sort to merge sort</li>
  <li>**Caching**: Implemented memoization in recursive solutions to significantly reduce the computation time for problems with overlapping subproblems</li>
  <li>**Code Cleanliness**: Ensured all code adheres to clean coding standards, making it more maintainable and easier to understand</li>
</ul>

These optimizations not only improved the performance of my solutions but also provided valuable learning experiences in writing efficient code

**Lessons Learned**
Throughout this project, I encountered numerous learning moments that contributed to my growth as a developer:

<ul>
  <li>**Algorithm Efficiency**: Learned to analyze the time and space complexity of different algorithms, helping me choose the most efficient approach for each problem</li>
  <li>**Language Proficiency**: Gained deeper insights into the capabilities of JavaScript, making me a more skilled developer</li>
  <li>**Problem-Solving Skills**: Improved my ability to break down complex problems into manageable parts and devise effective solutions</li>
  <li>**Continuous Improvement**: Embraced the importance of refactoring and optimizing code, understanding that the first solution is not always the best solution</li>
</ul>


These experiences have made me a more skilled and thoughtful developer, and I am excited to continue applying these lessons to future projects.
